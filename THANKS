Many thanks go to 

Jan Hambrecht for creating the KDE3 kicker applet KBrithday which 
inspired me to create this plasmoid. 

To create my first plasmoid I used the turorials from KDE techbase
especially the ones "Getting Started With Plasmoids" and 
"Writing A DataEngine" from ?.

Further hints on how to create a data engine and distribute an engine
toghether with an applet I got by looking at the todo list plasmoid 
from Javier Goday.

I found reading the source of the stock quote plasmoid from Ryan Winter
quite useful too.

To convert it to a popup applet I used lots of hints from the device
notifier plasmoid by Alexis MÃ©nard (?).

Thanks alot to Alain Protal for providing the French translation as well
for fixing quite a few bugs.

Many thanks to all of you for providing your work open source.

Thanks to all reporting bugs and providing patches.
