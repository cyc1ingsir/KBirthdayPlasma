This plasmoid was inspired by the KBirthday kicker
applet for KDE3, I've been using for years now.
Making a slow transition to KDE4 now, that was something
I was missing.
It reminds you at the birthdays and anniversaries of your
loved ones (in advance).

To install:

make sure, you have the following packages installed:
    -kde4pimlibs-devel
    -libqt4-devel
    -libkde4-devel
    -cmake
*Note: The names of the packages are take from openSUSE.
       They might differ from the package names in
       your distribution.

Unpack the archive and cd into the directory created.
Then issue the following command on the command line:

=====================================================
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ../
make 
sudo make install
=====================================================

If no 'kde4-config' exists on your installation, try
'kde-config' instead. If that fails as well, try to 
locate the installation path of your KDE4. If e.g. 
KDE4 is installed in /usr/kde4, replace the above command
with 
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

You might have to issue
  kdequitapp plasma
  plasma
in order to add the plasmoid to the list of available plasmoids

The addressbook.vcf file provided is containing test users.
It's quite useful to add them to KAddressbook of a seperate
account if one wants to test the applet. It contains quite a
few test cases around year change
